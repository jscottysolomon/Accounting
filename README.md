# Accounting Software
This software is designed to help accountants manage the bookkeeping for multiple companies. It allows users to import bank transactions from an XML file, and then apply rules to categorize the transactions and store them in an SQL database.

Currently, the software is in the early stages of development, and many features are either in development or are planned for the future. Some of the planned features include the ability to apply rules to specific companies, to create complex rules, to generate reports, and to import and export files.
